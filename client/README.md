# Business Model for Liteswap
## About the Project
Liteswap is a fork of Uniswap. It is a decentralized exchange that aims to provide liquidity for tokens, allows individuals stake crypto assets in order to generate rewards on the assets and aggregate members as DAO for cooperative contribution to stake in a liquidity so as to earn interest/reward together.
## Functions
The liteswap exchange will address some of the current problems being faced on Uniswap. these include:
* A double security measure to autheneticate tokens before they are listed on the exchange, this will prevent/reduce scammers from listing fake tokens
* To decrease slippage on the exchange
* The exchange is integrated to perform DAO, staking and farming
## Tokens
The exchange will provide a token called LITE. Public sale of the token will go for a minimum 0.1 BNB to a maximum of 10 BNB. There will also be private sale of investors who want to contribute higher than the initial public sale.
## Expectations/Profit
As users begin to use the exchange, there is going to be a significant rise for lite tokens. So users who paricipate in the sales will have something to smile about.
Another merit to the exchange is that it will ensure a low transaction fee so users will pay less to carry out their transactions.
Other features that will make the project viable and attract the investors will be included once the project is launched.
